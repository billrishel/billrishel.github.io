<h2>A Python Program for Finding the Closure of a Set of FDs</h2>
<p></p><span class="linehead" >
Definition
</span> - For a set F of functional dependencies, F<sup>+</sup> is the set of all FDs that can be derived from F. The approach for this algorithm is quite different from what used to find minimum covers, and opens up some interesting possibilities.</p>
<p>The F<sup>+</sup> program will be available by mid-August.</p>
